# Web App Deployment on AWS

This repository contains the code for a web application that can be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This guide will walk you through the process of deploying the web app to AWS using various services such as EC2, S3, and RDS, depending on your application's architecture.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment, ensure you have the following:

- AWS Account: If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
- Node.js/NPM: Make sure Node.js and NPM are installed on your machine.
- Git: To clone this repository and push changes.
- Your application code should be production-ready.

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Setup AWS EC2 Instance

1. Log in to your AWS Console.
2. Navigate to EC2 and launch a new instance with the required operating system (Linux/Ubuntu).
3. Choose an appropriate instance type (e.g., t2.micro for small-scale applications).
4. Configure your security group to allow HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and SSH (port 22) access.
5. Generate a key pair for SSH access to the instance.
6. Connect to the EC2 instance via SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
